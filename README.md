# Predictive Analytics Projects
Predictive Analytics is part of the Analytics course in my Master's program. It was focused on applying all of the concepts I had learned during my degree and applying them to extract meaningful business insights.

Each module is a new assignment focusedd on a new dataset. After applying data cleaning and transformation techniques, we implement Machine learning models to make predictions on outcomes. 

[Module 1 - Classifying Plant Species](https://github.com/TimPerera/PredictiveAnalyticsProjects/tree/main/mod1/solution.py). Predict the species of a plant based on the characteristics of a plant. 
[Module 2 - Predicting Bike Rentals](https://github.com/TimPerera/PredictiveAnalyticsProjects/tree/main/mod2/solution.ipynb). Using weather, I predict the number of bike rentals observed on a given day. 
[Module 3 - Creating an Effective Marketing Campaign](https://github.com/TimPerera/PredictiveAnalyticsProjects/blob/main/mod3/solution.ipynb). I attempt to understand what factors matters most when running a marketing campaign.

[Module 4 - Predicting House Prices in Nashville](https://github.com/TimPerera/PredictiveAnalyticsProjects/blob/main/mod4/solution.ipynb). Using information about a house, I attempt to predict the price of a house in Nashville. 

[Module 5 - Classifying Handwritten Letters](https://github.com/TimPerera/PredictiveAnalyticsProjects/blob/main/mod5/solution.ipynb). Using Convolutional Neural Networks, I create an algorithm designed to classify letters based on a presented image. 

Note: Module 3 - 5 was set up using an algorithm I created to create and install a custom data science environment. You can find out more about this [here](https://github.com/TimPerera/ds_automater).
